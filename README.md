# Reaction Role Bot
This project is for all of you who doesn't know how to work with reaction.  
Feel free to use this code in your bots, and only thing I would like you to do is credit me(Kall7) and legal.  
We have spent about 7-8h on it testing and fixing bugs, hope you'll enjoy it. 
 
# How to set up
1. To start bot first thing you would like to do is creat .env file where you'll add your token 
```
token = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
```
2. Is to install all packages just type in console `npm install` and it should install all of them
3. Type in console `npm start` and your bot should be up and running 

Enjoy!
P.S. if there was an issue while trying to start bot DM me on discord ( ٴ{°^°}Kall766{°^°}ٴ.js#0016 ) or use Issues tab in repository!
